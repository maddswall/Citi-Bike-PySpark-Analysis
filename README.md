## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Citi Bike usage within the New York community.

## Technology Stack
PySpark: We used the Python API for Apache Spark to handle scalable, fault-tolerant, and distributed data processing.

Docker: Our analysis was conducted within a Docker container created using the Jupyter PySpark image. This setup ensures that the code runs consistently, both locally and on an AWS cluster.

AWS: After thorough local testing, the code and data were deployed on an AWS cluster for final analysis.

## Environment
The analysis was performed in a Jupyter environment, which was essential for leveraging packages like Folium to create interactive maps.
